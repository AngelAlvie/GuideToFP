This is a small guide that I've been writing recently. There are a lot of technical mistakes (such as discussion of eager vs. lazy evaluation). I've been trying to edit it in my free time. I'm planning to add the following sections:
* Introduction
* Lambda Calculus
* Type Theory & Type Systems
* Introduction to Haskell
* (discussion of Scheme? or other dynamically checked language)
* (Category Theory)

I've been writing these as an exercise to see how well I actually understand the concepts of functional programming. They've been turning out well, except I really need to proofread and add many of the sections that I've omitted.
